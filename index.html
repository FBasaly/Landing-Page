                        <p><img src="./photos/Capture.PNG" style= "float:right" width="100%">Located just outside of the outskirts of Cairo on the esplanade known as the Giza Plateau, the Great Pyramids of Giza is the must-see Ancient Egyptian landmark. Known as Khufu's Pyramid, it is the greatest pyramid of the complex: a truly overwhelming sight. Being one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, it is the only one still standing to this day! When gazing at this colossal structure, there's no way to escape the feeling of being dwarfed.. The two smaller - but still huge - pyramids in Giza are those of Khafre and Menkaure. A few steps to...

                        <p><img src="./photos/Karnak.PNG" style= "float:left" width="100%">Karnak is an extraordinary complex of sanctuaries, kiosks, pylons and obelisks dedicated to the Theban triad but also to the greater glory of pharaohs. The site covers more than 2 sq km; it's large enough to contain about 10 cathedrals. At its heart is the Temple of Amun, the earthly 'home' of the local god. Built, added to, dismantled, restored, enlarged and decorated over nearly 1500 years, Karnak was the most important place of worship in Egypt during the New Kingdom.

                          <img src="./photos/Aswan.PNG" style= "float:left" width="100%">Located about 899 km south from Cairo, Aswan is a serene Nile Valley destination where the Nile is more majestic than anywhere else, flowing through granite rocks, and round emerald islands covered in palm groves and tropical plants. It is considered as an all-time favourite winter destination. Moreover, you'll be surprised to see how many monuments and sites this small city has to offer. Consider sailing to the temple of Philae,

                          <img src="./photos/Hurghada.PNG" style= "float:left" width="100%">The city of Hurghada is one of the main Egypt tourist attractions in the country as there is no better place than it where you can truly enjoy the beauty of the Red Sea. It stretches about 36 km (22 mi) along the seashore but too far into the desert and acts as a resort for native Egyptians from all over the country and especially foreign tourists as well.
